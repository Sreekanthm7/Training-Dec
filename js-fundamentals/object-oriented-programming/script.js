// objects are instantiated from a class, which functions like a blueprint

// objects are linked to a prototype object

//prototypal inhertance: the prototypal inheritance contains methods that are accessible to all objects linked to that prototype.

//Behaiviour is delegated to the linked prototype object

//constructor function: technique to create objects from a function
//this is how built-in objects like Arrays, Maps or Sets are actually implemented
//modern alternative to constructor function syntax
//syntactic sugar behind the scenes, ES6 classes work exactly like constructor functions.
//ES6 classes do NOT behave like classes in classes in "classical oop"


// const person = function(firstName, birthYear){
//     this.firstName = firstName;
//     this.birthYear= birthYear;

// };

// const jonas = new person('Jonas', 1991);
// console.log(jonas);
